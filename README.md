#  Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based **Algorithm Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step in real time. This educational tool is perfect for students, educators, and developers looking to understand or teach sorting algorithm logic in an interactive and intuitive way.

##ðŸš€ Features
Real-Time Sorting Visualization
Â Â Â Â - Visualize the internal workings of popular sorting algorithms in real-time.

Interactive and User-Friendly Interface
Â Â Â Â - Users can easily interact with the system to initiate sorting processes, select algorithms, or modify parameters.

Adjustable Speed Control
Â Â Â Â - Allows users to slow down or speed up the visualization, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced learners.

Array Size Customization
Â Â Â Â - Adjust the size of the array to visualize sorting behavior with different data volumes.
