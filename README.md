#  Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based **Algorithm Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step in real time. This educational tool is perfect for students, educators, and developers looking to understand or teach sorting algorithm logic in an interactive and intuitive way.

## 🚀 Features

-  Real-Time Sorting Visualization
      Visualize the internal workings of popular sorting algorithms in real-time.    
-  Interactive and User-Friendly Interface
      Users can easily interact with the system to initiate sorting processes, select algorithms, or modify parameters.  
-  Adjustable Speed Control
      Allows users to slow down or speed up the visualization, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced learners.
-  Array Size Customization
      Adjust the size of the array to visualize sorting behavior with different data volumes.
